# About collegeInvesto
collegeInvesto is an Ionic Mobile Application that helps users determine the minimum number of years needed to generate enough money to go to college. The application simply asks users to enter the initial investment amount, the amount of money needed to go to their desired college, and the projected annual rate(in percent). Once this information is provided, the application will calculate the number of years needed to generate their target amount and the balance.
